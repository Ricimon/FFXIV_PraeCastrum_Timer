# FFXIV PraeCastrum Timer
An Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) Plugin to show how much time is left in FFXIV Castrum/Praetorium cutscenes.

## Why?

Since Castrum and Praetorium are full of long, unskippable cutscenes, I'll often tab out to do other things when they start playing. However, to make sure I catch when the cutscene ends, I'll often tab back in to check the cutscene progress. I found this really annoying, so this plugin aims to remove the need for that. It parses ACT messages to detect when a cutscene begins, and shows a timer counting down to when the cutscene ends.
